# Python Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to my collection of Python-based data analysis projects. Each project explores a unique dataset and provides visual insights using `pandas` for data manipulation and `plotly.express` for interactive visualization.

## 🔍 Overview

This repository includes multiple standalone projects focused on data analysis and visualization. The primary goals of these projects are:

- Practicing data wrangling and exploration with `pandas`
- Creating clear, interactive visualizations with `plotly.express`
- Gaining insights from diverse datasets

Each project is self-contained in its own folder and includes:

- A Jupyter Notebook or Python script
- A dataset (if small) or a link to where it can be found
- A brief explanation of the analysis and findings

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **pandas** – for data manipulation and analysis
- **plotly.express** – for interactive visualizations
- (Optional: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, etc. depending on the project)
